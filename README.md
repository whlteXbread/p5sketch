# p5sketch
learning p5.js and webGL

## sketches
- [oscillosketch](https://whltexbread.github.io/p5sketch/oscillosketch/)

## acknowledgements
so far, i haven't done anything more than hack around on already-written code, specifically [Adam Ferriss' genuary repo](https://github.com/aferriss/genuary).

## notes
- using VSCode to write code, blus a couple helpful plugins:
	- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) will serve up your page/sketch and reload when you save. nice for quick iterations
	- [WebGL GLSL Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=raczzalan.webgl-glsl-editor) for syntax highlighting, signature info, and code completion in the shaders and offline documentation.
	- [p5.vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samplavigne.p5-vscode) to help on the `p5.js` side of things.

## lessons learned
- [must use `const` to specify constraints on `for` loops](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38986208/webgl-loop-index-cannot-be-compared-with-non-constant-expression/39298265#39298265)
