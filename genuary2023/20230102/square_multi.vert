/* notes

i am having trouble passing the center coords in for the squares from javascript. it seems like 
no matter what, the center value being used is [0, 0].

i ended up just trying something different. instead of passing a vector of float2s, i passed
two vectors of floats. it's only a little bit dumber, and maybe i can figure out how to
do the former later.
